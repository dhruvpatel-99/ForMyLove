From those scattered dates to overcoming long-distance challenges, every moment with you has only deepened my love. And here we are, nearly a year later, stronger and more in love than ever. Thank you for your patience, your understanding, and for just being you. I know I've had my silly moments, but I promise to keep improving for you. I'm endlessly grateful that you're in my life!",
