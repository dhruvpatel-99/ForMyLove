From those tiny dates spaced months apart to conquering long-distance hurdles, every moment with you has only deepened my love.\n\n You've left my brain and heart in a perpetual state of amazement just by being yourself. And here we are, almost a year down the line, stronger and more in love than ever. Thank you for your patience, your understanding, and for just being the incredible person that you are. I know I've had my moments of stupidity, but I promise to keep working on being the best boyfriend for you.\n\n I thank the stars every day for bringing you into my life. Here's to us, and to many more adventures together!",
